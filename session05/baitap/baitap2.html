        <p class="text"> Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her
            autobiographical
            songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural influence, Swift is a leading figure in pop music and a
            widely
            covered
            subject in the media, with a vast fanbase known as Swifties.

            Swift signed with Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift
            (2006)
            and
            Fearless (2008). The singles "Teardrops on My Guitar," "Love Story," and "You Belong with Me" achieved
            success
            on
            country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock into Speak Now (2010) and electronic elements into Red
            (2012),
            later transitioning her image from country to pop with the synth-pop album 1989 (2014); the ensuing media
            scrutiny
            inspired the hip-hop-infused Reputation (2017). The albums featured Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles
            such as
            "We Are
            Never Ever Getting Back Together," "Shake It Off," "Blank Space," "Bad Blood," and "Look What You Made Me
            Do."
